\section*{Exercises}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The expression $\alpha \vu$ for $\alpha \in \R$ and
unit vector $\vu \in \R^n$ defines a line of points that may be obtained by varying the
value of $\alpha$.
Derive an expression for the point $\vy$ that lies on this line that is
as close as possible to an arbitrary point $\vx \in \R^n$.
This operation of replacing a point by its nearest member within some set
is called {\em projection}.

\section*{Solutions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item We begin by defining the distance from $\vy$ to $\vx$. We would like to
find the $\vy$ that minimizes this distance:
\begin{equation}
|| \vx - \vy||^2.
\end{equation}
Next, we need to enforce the constraint that $\vy$ lies on the line defined
by $\alpha \vu$. We can do this simply by defining $\vy$ to be $\alpha \vu$.
\begin{equation}
|| \vx - \alpha \vu ||^2.
\end{equation}
Next, we expand the expression:
\begin{align}
& || \vx - \alpha \vu ||^2 \\
=& ( \vx - \alpha \vu )^\top (\vx - \alpha \vu) \\
=& \vx^\top \vx - 2 \alpha \vx^\top \vu + \alpha^2 \vu^\top \vu \\
=& \vx^\top \vx - 2 \alpha \vx^\top \vu + \alpha^2.
\end{align}
In the last line, we used the fact that $\vu$ is a unit vector to make
the simplification $\vu^\top \vu = 1$.

We can minimize this distance by taking the derivative with respect to
$\alpha$ and setting it to zero:
\begin{align}
& - 2  \vx^\top \vu + 2 \alpha = 0 \\
\Rightarrow & \alpha = \vx^\top \vu.
\end{align}

Recalling that $\vy = \alpha \vu$, we can conclude that $\vy = \vx^\top \vu \vu$.
